## Purpose
_Accomplish_ is an extension for people who are driven by deadlines and goals. It overrides Google Chrome's New Tab page to show a dashboard of your current goals, days remaining until deadlines, as well as a progress bar to show time spent. 

And on top of that, it shows snazzy full screen backgrounds on the New Tab page.

## Authors
This extension was developed by Brian Lam and Brian Yan, two software engineers at Microsoft.

## Build Instructions
Just in case I forget: I used [Koala](http://koala-app.com) to build and minify the JS and CSS assets. The raw JS and SASS goes in the build directory, and the resulting compiled and minified files go inside the assets directory.
